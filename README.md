# DASBook

**DASBook** is part of the **ETH100 Book Series**, dedicated to providing a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of **Data Availability Sampling (DAS)**‚Äîcovering both its foundational principles and future directions. As blockchain and Ethereum technologies become increasingly complex, relevant knowledge is often fragmented, rapidly evolving, and difficult to follow. The **ETH100 Book Series** aims to consolidate essential insights across various domains, present them in a structured way, and keep them up to date‚Äîsignificantly lowering the learning curve and helping readers stay informed.

## ‚ú® Writing Principles

DASBook is written with the following principles in mind:

- **Clarity First**: We emphasize underlying principles over implementation details. Even in cryptography-related sections, the material is explained using math no more advanced than what's taught in middle school‚Äîmaking the book accessible to a wide audience.
- **Comprehensive & Up-to-date**: From foundational concepts to the latest research, DASBook covers the full spectrum of topics relevant to DAS, including encoding theory, network design, and sampling. The content is continuously updated to reflect the cutting edge of the ecosystem.
- **Future-Oriented**: We embrace diverse possibilities and maintain an open, exploratory mindset.

## üìö Book Structure

DASBook is organized into three main parts:

- **Guide**: Introduces DAS from the ground up‚Äîits core concepts, encoding methods, and practical applications. Designed for beginners.
- **Advanced**: Explores technical foundations in depth, including network architecture, cryptographic theory, and encoding strategies. Aimed at readers seeking to understand how DAS works under the hood.
- **Research**: Covers forward-looking topics such as security modeling, threat analysis, sampling strategy design, network optimizations, and future architecture proposals. Suitable for researchers and developers entering the field.
