# 🚀 Getting Start

Welcome to the **deep end of Data Availability Sampling (DAS)**.

If you already understand the basic logic of data availability and are curious about the mechanisms behind it — you're in the right place.

This section offers a systematic overview of the key technologies underlying DAS. Rather than focusing on specific protocol details, we emphasize fundamental principles across four domains: cryptography, coding theory, network mechanisms, and on-chain integration.

Many of these topics (such as cryptography) are already well-covered elsewhere. Our goal is to reorganize them into a coherent, digestible structure, making them easier to understand and connect. As DAS is a rapidly evolving field, we also aim to keep this section up-to-date — creating **a single place to master all essential knowledge**.

### 📚 Book Structure Recap

To help you navigate based on your background and goals, this book is divided into three parts:

- **[Beginner](../guide/getting-started):** Accessible content to help you build intuitive understanding and historical context of DA.
- **[Advanced](../advanced/getting-started):** In-depth explanations of the cryptographic, coding, networking, and on-chain mechanics behind DAS.
- **[Research](../research/getting-started):** A curated summary of the most cutting-edge ideas, system models, security analyses, and proposals.

We’re continuously refining the **Advanced** section to strike the best balance between rigor and readability. If you have suggestions, feedback, or spot any issues, feel free to contact us:
