# 🚀 Getting Start

Welcome to the world of **Data Availability**.

Although data availability (DA) has been practiced in blockchain systems for years, it remains one of the most misunderstood concepts. Many users—and even developers—still have misconceptions about its true purpose and the core challenges it addresses.

That’s exactly why we wrote this book: to help you understand the principles and practical logic of data availability in a simple and accessible way. These foundational ideas make up the first part of this book — the **Beginner** section.

To lower the entry barrier, we’ve intentionally simplified some of the technical details and avoided overly formal rigor. If you’re already an expert in this field, you may find some explanations overly abstract — we appreciate your understanding.

### 📚 Book Structure

This book is organized into three parts, designed for readers at different stages:

- **[Beginner](../guide/getting-started):** Easy-to-understand introductions to help anyone interested in Ethereum scalability and DA technology.
- **[Advanced](../advanced/getting-started):** A deeper dive into the cryptographic tools, coding theory, network design, and on-chain logic behind DAS.
- **[Research](../research/getting-started):** A gateway into cutting-edge proposals, security models, and future directions — ideal for readers preparing to do in-depth research.

This book is a living project, and the beginner section will evolve based on your feedback. If you have any thoughts, questions, or suggestions, please reach out:
